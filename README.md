# R3F20T2
Milestone 1-2 for training task 2 Ryerson Rams Robotics
### Below are some of my scribblings for Task 2.
I use 3 points to check if a turn has been made. The points are then 'normalised' to unit vector form and then their values are compared to already specified tuples to see which type of turns were made.
The program sends single instruction at points which fall on straight lines but sends two instructions (one to turn and one to walk forward) on points which constitute a turn. For each instruction a request has to be made to the server from the client. I loved working on this milestone, I'm going to practise making everything from scratch to improve my skills.
